# Auction House
#### Authors: Jonathan Salazar, Cyrus McCormick

### How to Use:

This project is comprised of three components:
 1) The Bank system
 2) Auction House systems
 3) Users

In order to function properly, the bank must be the first system to be run; however, the order that any various auction
houses or users are initialized in do not matter.

To run the bank system use the following:

```java -jar <bank.jar>```

To run the Auction House system use the following:

```java -jar <AH.jar>```

To run the user use the following:

```java -jar <user.jar>```
